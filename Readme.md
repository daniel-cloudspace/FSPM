This repo will contain the firmware, software, and schematics for making an open source competitor to overpriced physics sensor suppliers for schools. The end goal is to produce a device which costs between $10 and $50, including sensors. 

Sensors we will implement
-------------------------
- Light Intensity
- Temperature
- Velocity
- Time
- Hall Effect Sensor
- Microphone
- Humidity
- Pressure

Output formats
--------------
- CSV on SD card
- Real-Time through Serial or USB to communicate with a Processing frontend

Also
----
And it will have a badass case that looks like a monkey or a squid or like a bowl with hair or something. Just trust us. That part will be awesome.
